			The Astra Militarum, also known as the Imperial Guard in colloquial Low Gothic, is the largest coherent fighting force 
			in the galaxy. They serve as the Imperium of Man's primary combat force and first line of defence from the myriad threats 
			which threaten the existence of the human race in the late 41st Millennium. It is comprised of countless billions of men and 
			women -- hundreds of thousands of different regiments, supported by a vast array of light and heavy armoured vehicles that 
			provide the Guard's primary offensive punch. 
			<br><br>
			The Astra Militarum are usually the first Imperial force to respond to a threat 
			if a world's Planetary Defence Force (PDF) fails to suppress it. They also garrison major locations of strategic or cultural 
			interest to the Imperium and are often found in defensive roles. Supported by legions of heavy armour and thundering artillery, 
			the Imperial Guard fight a never-ending war for the survival of Mankind in an unrelentingly hostile universe.
			<br><br>
			The Astra Militarum is often referred to as the "Hammer of the Emperor" -- the sheer amount of force that the Imperial 
			Guard can bring to bear on the enemy is devastating, but is not as direct or as precise as their Space Marine allies, who 
			are described as the "Scalpel of the Emperor." There is no universal uniform or regimental command hierarchy in the Imperial 
			Guard, although it is compulsory for every regiment to have at least one Commissar to maintain the discipline and morale of 
			the men while watching for any signs of corruption or taint in the ranks. However, it is worth noting that a number of worlds 
			copy the uniform used by the regiments of the Cadian Shock Troops, who are viewed as being the most effective of the Imperial 
			Guard's infantry units. 
			<br><br>
			The main tactic of the Imperial Guard is to overwhelm the enemy with their endless numbers, while at the 
			same time hammer them into submission with devastating artillery and crush them with powerful main battle tanks.

			</figure>
			<p>
			The Space Marines or Adeptus Astartes are foremost amongst the defenders of humanity, the greatest of the Emperor of 
			Mankind's warriors. They are barely human at all, but superhuman; having been made superior in all respects to a normal 
			man by a harsh regime of genetic modification, psycho-conditioning and rigorous training.
			<br><br>
			Space Marines are untouched by plague or any natural disease and can suffer wounds that would kill a lesser being 
			several times over, and live to fight again. Clad in ancient Power Armour and wielding the most potent weapons known to 
			man, the Space Marines are terrifying foes and their devotion to the Emperor and the Imperium of Man is unyielding. They 
			are the God-Emperor's Angels of Death, and they know no fear.
			<br><br>
			Potential Space Marines are usually, but not always, recruited from the worlds where a Chapter has established its 
			fortress-monastery, although some Chapters are known to recruit from a collection of different worlds in an area of space 
			that they protect or frequent.
			<br><br>
			Recruiting methods vary from Chapter to Chapter. Some select their Neophytes from feral tribes roaming the surface of 
			inhospitable worlds, while others draw upon eager volunteers who have been groomed from birth to become an Astartes. Still 
			others watch and kidnap potential warriors, turning them into Astartes whether they will it or not. Whatever the method, all 
			Space Marine Chapters will only accept those who successfully pass the grueling initiation trials and prove themselves worthy 
			of becoming a Space Marine.
			<br><br>
			However a man becomes a Space Marine does not matter: once his body has been forged into that of a transhuman Astartes, 
			he must forever stand apart from the people to whom he was once kin and who he is now sworn to protect. Once a man becomes 
			a Space Marine, he is no longer mortal; his genetic heritage is now that of the Emperor Himself, and a spark of the same 
			divine majesty flows in his veins.
			<br><br>
			There are approximately 1,000 Space Marine Chapters active in the Imperium of Man at any one time. Since the 
			opening of the Great Rift, these Chapters have been comprised of a mixture of traditional Firstborn Space Marines 
			and the even more enhanced Primaris Space Marines, or may contain only Primaris Marines.

			</figure>
			<p>
			The Imperial Navy, known as the Navis Imperialis in High Gothic, is one of the primary armed forces of the Imperium of Man.
			<br><br>
			While the Astra Militarum (Imperial Guard) represents the Imperium's ground forces, the Imperial Navy is responsible for the 
			fleets of starships that maintain order between the stars and planets in the Imperium, for all space and air support provided 
			to the infantry of the Astra Militarum through its Aeronautica Imperialis branch, and for transporting those Guardsmen across 
			the galaxy to the Imperium's myriad warzones.
			<br><br>
			In ancient times, during the Great Crusade and Horus Heresy eras, the Imperial Navy was not an independent armed force of its 
			own but was considered a part of the greater Imperial Army and was known as the Imperialis Armada.
			Its vessels were dedicated to the defence of Imperial space and strategic Warp routes. This was opposed to the fleets of 
			warships assigned to the service of the Legiones Astartes, who were used for the planetary assaults that occupied the bulk of 
			the Great Crusade.
			<br><br>
			After the horrors of the Horus Heresy, during the Imperial Reformation overseen by the Primarch Roboute Guilliman, 
			the Imperial Army's fleet component was reestablished as a a separate and rival service. This was done to weaken the Imperial 
			armed forces in case of the outbreak of a future rebellion against the Emperor's rule.

				<figcaption style="font-size: 90%; text-align: center;">Mars Alpha pattern, Warlord-class Titan.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
			The Collegia Titanica is the division of the ancient Mechanicum and the current Adeptus Mechanicus that operates and oversees 
			the Titans, the colossal Imperial war machines that are the most powerful engines of war in the Imperium of Man.
			The Collegia is also more rarely known as the Adeptus Titanicus (a contraction of "Adeptus Mechanicus Collegia Titanica") 
			and as the Legio Titanicus in ancient records dating back to the Great Crusade and the Horus Heresy.
			<br><br>
			Born of the time during the Age of Strife when the first temples to the Omnissiah were being raised on Mars, the Titans are 
			the personification of the military might available to the Emperor of Mankind. Bristling with massive cannons and missile 
			launchers capable of wreaking terrible destruction upon an enemy, they dominate the battlefields of the galaxy and are a 
			testimony to the consummate skills of the Tech-priests of the Cult Mechanicus.
			<br><br>
			Every Titan is part of a larger unit called a Titan Legion. Each Titan Legion is based on a Mechanicus Forge World and 
			remains under the direct control of the Adeptus Mechanicus, who jealously guard these mighty war machines and have the 
			power to sanction which war zones they will commit their forces to.
			<br><br>
			The Titan Legions of the Adeptus Mechanicus are amongst the most powerful military entities within the Imperium of Man. 
			Ancient and implacable, Titans are colossal engines of war, massive robotic combat walkers the size of multi-story buildings 
			rightly known as "god-machines" or "god-engines" to the Tech-priests, who revere them as the physical embodiments of the 
			Machine God. Even the smallest class of Titan is mighty enough to destroy an entire tank squadron in a span of seconds or 
			level a city block. Each Titan Legion is its own ancient warrior order inextricably linked to the Forge World (or worlds) 
			on which it is based.
