		</figure>
		<p>The Imperium was founded by the Emperor of Mankind, also called "The God-Emperor" and the "Master of Mankind", 
			at the end of the Age of Strife, in the 30th Millennium AD. The Emperor, an immortal being born around the year 8,000 BC in 
			central Anatolia on Old Earth, was the collective reincarnation of all the human shamans who possessed true psychic 
			abilities during the Paleolithic and Neolithic Ages. 
			<br><br>
			Imbued with their combined psychic, physical and intellectual power, 
			the Emperor was born an immortal being of unparalleled physical strength, psychic ability, charisma 
			and intellect. The Emperor helped humanity as a whole survive and prosper through the long millennia. In various 
			eras of human history He intervened through various personas, some of them well-known historical personages, to guide 
			Mankind, though such interventions were always brief and shrouded in legend and historical mystery.
			<br><br>
			At the end of the Age of Strife in the 29th Millennium, the man who would become the Emperor finally took a direct, public, 
			and permanent role in shaping the future of humanity, believing that the damage done to the human race by 5,000 years of terror, 
			isolation and violence could not be reversed unless He openly guided humanity as its leader.
			As such, He shed all His prior identities and simply revealed Himself in the late 29th Millennium on Terra as the "the Emperor," 
			determined to unite the entire species under His stern but benevolent rule. He intended to replace superstition, fear, 
			poverty and intolerance with reason, science, progress and hope.
			<br>
			<hr>
			The Emperor continues, at least nominally, to rule the Imperium as both its political master and its primary religious figure. 
			However, His badly damaged body is interred within the cybernetic life support mechanisms of the arcane device known as the 
			Golden Throne following His mortal wounding during the ancient interstellar civil war of the Horus Heresy.
			<br><br>
			Because of this terrible fate, the Emperor is incapable of interacting with others on a day-to-day basis and has left the basic 
			governance of His Imperium to the Senatorum Imperialis, an oligarchic ruling council of the most powerful noble lords and 
			Adepts in the galaxy. The Senatorum Imperialis is currently led by the Emperor's genetic son, the Primarch Roboute Guilliman, 
			who chairs the council and directs Imperial policy as the Lord Commander of the Imperium.

		<h2>The Imperium of Man</h2>

			Map of the Imperial controlled space in the end of the Great Crusade.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>The Imperium is the largest and currently most powerful political entity in the galaxy, consisting of at least 1,000,000 
			human-settled worlds dispersed across most of the Milky Way Galaxy. Consequently, an Imperial planet might be separated 
			from its closest neighbour by hundreds or even thousands of light years.
			<br><br>
			As a stellar empire, the size of the Imperium cannot be measured in terms of contiguous territory, but only in the 
			number of planetary systems under its control. However, most humans in the galaxy have little day-to-day contact with the 
			government of the Imperium unless they serve in one of its Adepta or run afoul of its various protectors, such as the Inquisition 
			or the Adeptus Arbites.
			<br><br>
			The Imperium is primarily an interstellar tribute empire, allowing its member worlds to largely govern themselves as long 
			as they recognise the authority of the Emperor and His servants and support the state religion, the Imperial Cult, which holds 
			the Emperor to be the one, true God of Mankind.
			<br><br>
			Every world of the Imperium must also pay the Imperial taxes levied on them in the form of troops and materiel 
			that is known as the Imperial Tithe. These resources go to the service of the Astra Militarum and the Imperial Navy, the 
			armed forces which keep the Imperium united and safe.
			The Imperial Tithe supports the overall economy of the Imperium by redistributing resources where needed, usually to shore 
			up one region of the Imperium where conflict is raging by drawing resources from more peaceful sectors.
			<br>
			<hr>

				<img src="images/text_hivecity.jpg" class="img fluid textimg" alt="Imperial hivecity" style="width: 90%;">
				<figcaption style="font-size: 90%; text-align: center;">A hivecity, on the planet Armageddon.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			In general, the Imperium promotes the development of a neo-feudal political system, which the High Lords of Terra and the 
			Inquisition have long believed to be the most stable form of human government. There are few human-settled worlds in the 
			galaxy where any but the most wealthy nobles have any say in the government of their planet, and the Imperial establishment 
			generally characterises any movements toward "democracy," self-rule or the overthrow of the neo-feudal system as outright 
			heresy against the divine plan of the God-Emperor.
			<br><br>
			This intense need for political stability and the growing military demands upon the Imperial system 
			presented by the myriad and growing threats of the 41st Millennium have created a repressive and stagnant 
			galactic government.
			In the present Imperium, science and human progress have essentially been halted in service to the need to simply maintain 
			the crumbling status quo. It is not for nothing that many Imperial savants consider the current age the "Time of Ending" for
			Mankind.
			<br><br>
			However, despite its myriad problems, without the admittedly authoritarian and often harsh protection of the Imperium, 
			Mankind as a whole would have fallen prey to the countless perils that threaten it. Without the Imperium of Man and Mankind's 
			faith in the Emperor who guides it, the human race would have become extinct long ago.
